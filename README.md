# 10ff-automater
this is just used to auto type on the website 10ff.net 
it inputs each letter in every single word each one at a time .

    -Usage

        -As soon as the 10 seconds countdown finsishes, a hovering window prompt will appear.
            -Other event other than the counter is welcomed !
        -Fill in the desired WPM in plain form, or accompanied by other negligible characters.
            -The script is foolproof when it comes to appending other textual data.
                -This isn't overengineering, but a fallback to remedy potential typos.
                -The additional conditions will be last checked, to avoid their computationally intensive operations.

    -TODO

        -Get the script to be more responsive, by getting functions to be more asynchronous 
            -Currently the DOM becomes partially unresponsive, whenever the script runs.
        -Having the user's desirable WPM to match the site's meter accurate, rather than a stray approximation.
        -Chrome extension
            -Getting the chrome extension's to use chrome sync storage.
            -Providing UI elements to specify the WPM, rather than prompting the user each time with a hovering window.
